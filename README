This is an example of using Ember.js with drag and drop events.

I wanted to illustrate using bindings, HTML5 drag and drop, and Rails in a way
where you could make something slightly more complicated than a simple TODO app.

Given some more time, I'd like to add the following:

* a way to move commas within a sentence, and to drag them out of the sentence
* support for touch devices
* some sort of real backend instead of using static content
* better css
