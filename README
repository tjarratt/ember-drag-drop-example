This is an example of using Ember.js with drag and drop events.

I wanted to illustrate using bindings, HTML5 drag and drop, and Rails in a way
where you could make something slightly more complicated than a simple TODO app.

Given some more time, I'd like to add the following:

* a way to move commas within a sentence, and to drag them out of the sentence
* show a validated message when the sentence is correct
* support for touch devices
* some sort of real backend instead of using static content
* better css, especially for items that can be dragged

In general, my approach was to:

* take the example sentences
* split them on whitespace
* add each word as a drop target

and to provide a draggable area for adding commas

From a UX/UI perspective, it would take a fair amount of style to make this obvious
to users, but this approach allows for situations where sentences have both too
many and too few commas and the user has to add / remove them.

Ember is a fairly good choice for this because its bindings provide an easy way to
update words and keep the entire sentence in sync with the changes users make.

The markup is all text, without any images or other markup, which keeps the
entire document accessible to, say, screen readers, or other use cases where
accessibility matters.

Another approach might have been to create the entire sentence as a collection of
drag and droppable words + punctuation, and users would need to put it in the
"correct order". That would be slightly more challenging, but would be easier to
translate to touch events for tablets and phones.
